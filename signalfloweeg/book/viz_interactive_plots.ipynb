        "When plotting EEG data using MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks or similar notebook environments like Quattro, the choice of magic command impacts the interactivity of the resulting plot:\n",

        "**Inline magic command (%matplotlib inline):**\n",
        "- Produces a static, non-interactive plot embedded within the notebook\n",
        "- Faster rendering compared to interactive plots\n",
        "\n",
        "**Widget magic command (%matplotlib widget):**\n",
        "- Creates an interactive plot within the notebook\n",
        "- Allows zooming, panning, and other interactive features\n",
        "- Slower performance compared to the pop-out version using the QT framework\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pop-out version (QT framework):**\n",
        "- Generates a separate interactive plot window outside the notebook\n",
        "- Offers the fastest performance among the plotting options\n",

        "In summary, while the widget magic command provides interactivity within the notebook, it comes with a performance trade-off. The inline magic command offers faster static plots, and the pop-out version using QT delivers the best performance. Notebooks can be utilized on remote systems, facilitating EEG data analysis and visualization in various settings.\n",
