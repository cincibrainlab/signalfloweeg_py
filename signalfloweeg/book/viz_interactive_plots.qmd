## Notes on Visualizations:
When plotting EEG data using MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks or similar notebook environments like Quattro, the choice of magic command impacts the interactivity of the resulting plot:

**Inline magic command (%matplotlib inline):**
- Produces a static, non-interactive plot embedded within the notebook
- Faster rendering compared to interactive plots

**Widget magic command (%matplotlib widget):**
- Creates an interactive plot within the notebook
- Allows zooming, panning, and other interactive features
- Slower performance compared to the pop-out version using the QT framework

**Pop-out version (QT framework):**
- Generates a separate interactive plot window outside the notebook
- Offers the fastest performance among the plotting options

**Remote systems and notebooks:**
- Notebook environments like Jupyter can be used on remote systems
- Enables EEG data analysis and visualization through remote access solutions such as Visual Studio Code Tunnels

In summary, while the widget magic command provides interactivity within the notebook, it comes with a performance trade-off. The inline magic command offers faster static plots, and the pop-out version using QT delivers the best performance. Notebooks can be utilized on remote systems, facilitating EEG data analysis and visualization in various settings.
